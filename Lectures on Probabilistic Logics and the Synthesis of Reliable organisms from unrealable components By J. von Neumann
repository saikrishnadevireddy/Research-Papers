Introduction
The introduction part explains the purpose of the paper- the role of errors in logics or in the implementation of logics- in automata-synthesis. Errors should not be treated as exterior to the process but rather they are a part of the process.
Author feels that the present error treatment is not satisfactory. Errors should be treated by the Thermodynamical methods. The present treatment acts as a building block to the final structure.
Author thanks R.S. Pierce on whose notes this paper is based on. Also, special mention to the California Institute of Technology and the audience for the warm reception.

Logics and Automata
It has been pointed out that the constructive logics and intuitionistic logics can be best studied under Automata.
Logical proportions are represented with symbols whereas nervous system can be represented with neurons and electrical system with relays.
A logical representation is a black box with number of inputs and corresponding outputs.
However, the logics doesn't capture the delay of time which the nervous system associates with. There is a lag between the input and the output.

Key words

Synthesis- the combination of components or elements to form a connected whole.
Logics- the systematic use of symbolic and mathematical techniques to determine the forms of valid deductive argument. 
Automata- A moving mechanical device made in imitation of a human being
